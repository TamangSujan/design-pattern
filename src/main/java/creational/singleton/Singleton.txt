Singleton is creational design pattern which doesn't let you to create multiple instance of it
rather giving same object making global instance.

A real world example:
    There can be only one government in a country no matter who runs it.

In this code example:
    Singleton class is made with static and class is made private in order to prevent to make another class.

    Get method will return the same object.
