Prototype is a creational design pattern which lets you copy existing objects.

A real life example:
    A prototype object which is used to copy and produce in mass.

In this code example:
    Candy implements CloneableCandy for cloning itself.
    OrangeBall creates new object populating same price value to new OrangeBall.
