Bridge is a structural design pattern which separates group of related attributes in instance
and join as a whole instance.

By using this pattern, each instance can be build independently.

A real world example:
    GUI Window - If we open browser, each OS window design is different.
    We can perform same request in different OS, browser window may look different but the content inside looks same.

In this code example:
    Remote and Device are separated but remote acts as a support bridge to toggle device.

    Each remote is associated with a different device.
    It can interact like turning on/off, changing volume and channel.
