FlyWeight is a structural design pattern which allows you to re-use immutable object.

In real life example:
    Using template and adding form value to print form for different individuals
    rather than creating different form manually to print.

In a code example:
    FlyWeightImage is a immutable object which can be re-use.
    FlyWeightFactory will give you those instance which can be re-used.
