Adaptor is a structural design pattern where it makes incompatible interface to collaborate.

A real life example:
    F Type Socket is able to connect with F Type Plug.
    In order for connect to F Type Socket for other type plug such as I Type Plug
    We need an adaptor that connects I Type Plug and connects to F Type Socket in order to received charge.

In this code example:
    There are two types of sockets: F Type and I Type
    There are two types of plug: F Type and I Type

    Socket has method to connect Plug

    One is not compatible to another

    FTypeIPlugAdaptor is a type of adaptor that connects FTypeSocket to ITypePlug
