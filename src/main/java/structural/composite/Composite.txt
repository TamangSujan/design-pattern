Composite is a structural design pattern where objects instances are in tree structure.
All those object instances are separate independent instances.

A real world example:
    Each army soldiers are independent human being and there exists hierarchy based on ranks.
    There is one COAS General and two Lieutenant General below him and list goes on.

In this code example:
    There is individual box which can store list of items and list of box.
    Each of the list of box can hold items and list of box.

    Item has a name and price.

    Finally, the getTotalPrice will return the price of itself and its child boxes.
