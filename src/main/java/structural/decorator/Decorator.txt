Decorator is a structural design pattern which can be thought of wrapper design pattern
which wraps or decorate additional task as per need.

A real life example:
    A human being without any shirt.
    If he feels cold then he will wear shirt.
    And again if he feels more cold then he will add jacket above shirt.

In this code example:
    Decorator is initialized with cloth.
    Each decorator instance can decorate with new Decorator.

    It can show a list of decoration inside of it using showDecoration.
