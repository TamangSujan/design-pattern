Facade is a structural design pattern which let you required things while all the work are done behind the scene
which are not necessary for implementers to see.

A real world example:
    We transact money from ATM using ATM Card using its interface.
    We do not need to know how it handles behind the scene.
    We insert card, give pin number and balance amount.
    If all the criteria meets, it will give us money that we requested.

In this code example:
    Atm is a Facade which gives method withdraw which required ATM Card.
    After inserting card, it asks the PIN and amount.
    If all the criteria meets, it will return balance amount.
