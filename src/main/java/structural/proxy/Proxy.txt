Proxy is a structural design pattern where a proxy object is created in order
to reduce overhead on original object.

A real life example:
    Caching data so that frequent read operation are not done from original source
    rather than getting same data from cache source as the data is same until it has been manipulated.

In this code example:
    ProxyNoteService allows us to get copy instance of UserNote.
    It will give you same UserNote which is not an original note from database.
    If any update is happen, it will save in database and actual copied instance.
