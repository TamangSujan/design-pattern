Iterator is a behavioral design pattern which allows us to traverse through elements without
underlying its mechanism of any collection types.

A real life example:
    Travelling to different cities which can be decided using virtual map or hiring human guide.

In this code example:
    BLinkedList and BArrayList both have different mechanism of storing data.
    Both provides a iterator method which will traverse on a same way.
    It removes complexity of knowing how each list traverse.
