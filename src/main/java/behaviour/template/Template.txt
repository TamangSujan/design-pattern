Template is a behavioral design pattern which allows to re-use task which is repeating
and only override which needs to be different.

A real life example:
    A house must have walls but number of windows, doors, and other can be chosen according to need.

In this code example:
    Gateway transact method will process in a series.
    It first calls to the url, gets response and process and return LogResult
    Finally it saved Log

    Each implementation eSewa and Khalti has its own api to call and its response is process in different way
    and rest works are same.
