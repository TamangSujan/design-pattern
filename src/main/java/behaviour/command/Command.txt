Command is a behavioural design pattern which is used to create a set of instruction by populating all
the necessary information and later executing when required.

A real world example:
    A customer order some food in a restaurant
    Waiter write it down all the request in a piece of paper
    Waiter paste the order paper in a wall near to Chef
    Chef prepare the food
    Waiter bring back the food to teh customer

In this code example:
    There are two command LogReadCommand and LogSaveCommand
    LogReadCommand will read out all the logs which was saved
    LogSaveCommand will save the log in LogHandler
