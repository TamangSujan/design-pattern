State is a behavioral design pattern which allows to function based on state.

A real world example:
    When phone is unlocked, various things can be done.
    When phone is locked, power button and other button can only light up screen to unlock it.

In this code example:
    BlogUser is able to create a BlogDocument and becomes owner.
    A new document automatically has Draft State where only creator can write.

    As non-creator tries to read document, it will not allow to read the content.

    When in published state, even the creator is unable to write but all users can read the document.
