Chain of Responsibility is a behavioural design pattern which passes to its next instance after it has completed its own work.
Additional Logic can be done inside whether to pass to next or halt the request.

A real life example:
    A customer calling to customer care representative in order to understand the query.
    If CSR doesn't know the solution, s/he will request internally who knows the answer and forwards to it.
    The chain goes on finally getting the proper answer.

In this code example:
    Various filters such as QuerySanitizer, Authentication and Authorization filters are inserted in FilterChain.

    The method chain inside FilterChain will call the first filter and then that filter will call chain calling second filter
    and it goes on.
