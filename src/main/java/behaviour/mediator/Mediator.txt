Mediator is a behavioural design pattern which lets you reduce dependencies
between objects. It restricts direct communication between objects and forces
them to collaborate using mediator.

A real life example:
    Road vehicles following instructions of traffic police who acts as a mediator.

In this code example:
    A GUIMediator handles BButton and BCheckBox and their events.
    We simply uses click or check method and do not need to know what going behind the scene.
    GUIMediator is invoked behind the scene which handles these events.
