Observer is a behavioral design pattern which will observe any changes and notify to specific members.

A real world example:
    Youtube pops notification if any publisher has uploaded any new video where subscriber has subscribed to that publisher.

In this code example:
    MediaPublished will hold a list of subscriber who wants subscription.
    MediaSubscriber will subscribe interested publisher.

    When publisher publish any content, it will update all the subscriber it has.
