Factory Pattern is a type of design pattern where an instance of object is only build and given from one central builder.
It is generally designed and use in order to prevent manual generation from scratch.

A real life example:
    Purchasing a flour from factory is really efficient in time and quality rather than producing own flour.

Everything is done behind the scene and it is ready to be used whenever needed.

In this code example:
    VehicleFactory is responsible to create Vehicle based on VehicleType.
    It has two types: Motorcycle and Truck

    Once desired vehicle is build, we can transport from that vehicle.
